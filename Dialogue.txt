You wake up and move towards the centre of the chamber.
It's dark, wet, and stoney
you are cold.

There is a passageway to your left and to your right,
You cannot see into either.
Where do you go?
(1) left
(2) right
**

**Node 3: A
You politely excuse yourself and run in opposite direction as far as you can
Before you know it your surroundings are unrecognisable
Yout run slows to a walk as you a terrible scene fills your vision
Against the wall leans a skeleton
A dried and bloodied knife sits beside It
Suddenly!
you hear something strange:
**
French

**Node 3: B
There's a buzzing in your pocket
**


**Node 3: Z
Looking up from your phone there are two options
(1) grab the knife from the skeleton
(2) leave silently
**

**Node 1: A
The darkness is suffocating as you sneak through a hallway
Continuing in silence you enter a dingy cell
And so does a stranger from a door to your right
Although previously looking at his phone he locks eyes with yours.
He speaks at you although you do not understand his words

Something pops up onto your phone

**Node 1: Z
The man has his hand outstretched
It appears as though he wants you to shake it
Hidden in his sleeves snaking around his arm you see a strange device.
(1) leave through the other door
(2) Shake his hand
**

**Node 4: A
Grabbing the man's hand was a clear mistake
You can recall the look in his eyes as he activated the strange contraption
The teleport has left you feeling queasy and cloudy minded
Looking you see something marvellous
Everywhere you look brilliant bright blue glowing mushrooms
A whole forest of them.
You notice the smaller bright blue glowing mushroom standing on top of you
It appears to be sentient
**


**Node 4: Z
The shock from both teleporting and seeing a really funguy has worn off
You pick it up and punt it into the distance.
You feel better.
(1) You walk through the luminescent covered opening to your left
(1) You get down and crawl towards the hole on your left
**

**Node 7: A
You can smell the zone before you can see it
Just beyond the way you see a grim foreboding red mushroom forest
Red is your least favourite colour
...
..
The trek was arduous but you have found yourself on top of a large hill
The hill is (mushroom) capped by a tree 
In its shadow lies an hypnotising apple, a miasma of colour on its skin
The guardian snake gently descends from the tree and bares its fangs

**Node 10: A
Hallway.
Hallways.
One path.
Forever.
And ever
**

**Node 10: B
The Hallway has turned into a spiral staircase
After delving deeper(higher?) into this maze you feel as though you are close
To what? You don’t know.
The walls and floor feel thin
They reverberate periodically. Rippling through the infinity you came from.
This you push past.
Then you find something.
A giant abyss housing a great big nothing that still beats
like a memory
A stray thought crosses your mind
One That doesn’t belong to you.

You walk down a dimly lit hallway.
A spiderweb clings to your face and you brush it aside.
A warm, comforting light emanates from an open door.
Inside you find an old man listening to classical music.

The door is jammed.

You enter another room.
Caustics flicker off the ceiling. The walls appear to be made of glass. There are two portals on either wall
Behind the glass is water, stretching as far as the eye can see. 
A crab floats lazily along the left wall. It sports a magnificent Fu Manchu moustache.
He begins to speak in a velvety voice.

You walk down a long hallway. It smells earthy.
As you round a corner, you hear the sound of tiny voices.
You enter a garden full of busy gnomes. They are performing a ritual.
They stop,
Turn,
And look directly at you.
They begin to chant as one:

DEATHS:

**Node 6: D
Earthworm Jim (or was it Larry?) leads you down the hallway.
Suddenly!
Jim pulls out a tiny worm-sized knife and stabs your big toe.
You hop around in mild pain but fail to notice the trap door on the side of the hallway. 
You land directly on it, it opens, and you fall to your death.
Your last thought is:
“Betrayal by an earthworm is not a noble way to die”
***

**Node 9: D
You begin to dance with the gnomes. 
They seem to be worshipping some sort of sun god.
You are so entranced by the coordination of the tiny people that you fail to notice a garden shovel being sharpened.
As if on cue, the gnomes swarm around you and lift you off your feet.
They carry you over to a human-sized picnic bench.
You realise much too late that you are about to become a human sacrifice.
The last words you hear before the shovel pierces your chest are:
“YOU JUST GOT GNOMED”

**Node 11: D
You walk into a musty-smelling staff room. A plate of muffins sits on the counter.
Suddenly!
An evil stapler hops its way across the kitchen counter. 
Before you can react, it jumps onto your face.
In quick succession it staples your eyes, mouth and nose closed.
You can no longer breathe.
As you run out of air you hear the stapler assailant clacking evilly.
As if it is laughing…
***

**Node 3: D
You take the knife from the skeleton.
Not like it's going to need it anyways
It doesn't. 
The skeleton stands up and hits you with its skeleton slam attack.
As your consciousness fades you hear a few final words.
“I've got a bone to pick with you!”
Black

**Node 10: D
That mushroom is yours. 
You run.
You jump.
You dodge.
Snake overextended it’s attack and the head is far away from the tree
It moves to twist around slamming its body towards you hoping to pin you against the tree.
Unfortunately for the snake you’re a baller.
Grabbing the fallen apple you dive through a gap in the snake's paltry defences.
Safely out of its range you stare it right in the eyes and take a bite.
You die instantly.
