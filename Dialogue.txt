**Node 3: A
You politely excuse yourself and run in opposite direction as far as you can
Before you know it your surroundings are unrecognisable
Yout run slows to a walk as you a terrible scene fills your vision

Suddenly!
you hear something strange:

(1) Shake his hand
(2) leave through the other door

**Node 4: A
Grabbing the man's hand was a clear mistake
You can recall the look in his eyes as he activated the strange contraption
The teleport has left you feeling queasy and cloudy minded
Looking you see something marvellous
Everywhere you look brilliant bright blue glowing mushrooms
A whole forest of them.
You notice the smaller bright blue glowing mushroom standing on top of you
It appears to be sentient
