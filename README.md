# The Game

<p>
You are stuck in a mysterious land. It is full of strange creature and even stranger locations.
Even the language that the locals speak is unintelligable to you. It is perhaps a French dialect. Nevertheless, you must attempt to translate the useful tips the locals will give you. Unfortuntely, your GENERIC TRANSLATE APP is corrupted and does not translate properly. To debug, you must solve puzzles. The accuracy of the resulting translation depends on your puzzle-solving proficiency. 

Beware of unscrupulous creatures luring you to certain death. But, play it too safe, and you could become forever lost.
